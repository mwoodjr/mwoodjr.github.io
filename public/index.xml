      <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy! I&amp;rsquo;m Miguel! I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Plano East Senior High School, currently enjoying my Senior year. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been captivated by how technology shapes our lives, which inspired me to pursue a career that combines creativity, innovation, and my love for computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-journey&#34;&gt;My Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. My fascination with technology began early—I was the kid who was always curious about how things worked. I’d often sit with my father as he tinkered with his custom-built computer, trying to learn as much as I could. By the time I was seven, I was installing operating systems on my computer, experimenting, and diving deeper into the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
