Howdy! I'm Miguel! I'm a student at Plano East Senior High School studying computer science. I've always been interested in how technology shapes our daily lives from a very young age, which led me to pursue a career where I could explore and learn new things.

## My Journey

I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. From the day I was born, I was fascinated by anything with an on-and-off switch. I would sit with my father as he tinkered with his custom-built computer, and as a toddler, I would try my best to help him.

## Education

I am currently working to graduate high school and pursue a degree in Information Technology or Computer Science. My whole life I've always wanted to work with computers and technology, it's my dream job. In Middle School, I took my first entry-level computer science class where we were just making shapes in Python, but it did come with a free Repl.it subscription so that helped with me making little side projects and learning more than my peers. In High School, I took CS1 learning Java and was approached by my teacher during the first quarter about my expertise and knowledge that suprassed my own teacher. Safe to say she was impressed and she granted me special permission to take AP Computer Science Fundamentals as an "extracurricular" since that was the class that I initially wanted to be put into however due to class size complications it wasn't possible. Now it was! Currently, I'm taking CS2 due to course restrictions preventing me from taking any AP Computer Science classes until my Senior year. My academic path has been a blend of challenging and rewarding experiences, shaping my understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of computing.

## Beyond the Classroom

Outside of my education, I am fun, easy-going, and extroverted! I’m always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself, grow, and develop to be the best version of myself I can be.

- **Fine Arts:** I’ve been doing choir since 6th grade and have no plans to stop! I enjoy working as a team with others and the enjoyment of everyone around me whenever we accomplish a new goal as a choir. I was also in the top jazz choir my Sophomore year in Junior High school, and I’m currently in the top choral choir for my Senior High.

## Looking Ahead

I am always eager to explore opportunities that allow me to contribute to meaningful projects that leverage technology to improve lives. I am particularly interested in the fields of educational technology and sustainable computing, especially in today’s modern age, where it seems that there’s something new every day!
