Howdy! I'm Miguel! I'm a student at Plano East Senior High School, currently enjoying my Senior year. I've always been captivated by how technology shapes our lives, which inspired me to pursue a career that combines creativity, innovation, and my love for computers.

## My Journey

I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. My fascination with technology began early—I was the kid who was always curious about how things worked. I’d often sit with my father as he tinkered with his custom-built computer, trying to learn as much as I could. By the time I was seven, I was installing operating systems on my computer, experimenting, and diving deeper into the tech world.

## Education

I'm currently preparing to graduate high school and pursue a career at the intersection of Business and Technology. My passion for computers blossomed in middle school when I took my first computer science class. It was a humble beginning—drawing shapes in Python—but it sparked something bigger. 

In high school, I advanced my skills further by excelling in Java during CS1, which caught the attention of my teacher. She recognized my potential and granted me special permission to take AP Computer Science Fundamentals as an extracurricular. That opportunity became a pivotal moment in my journey, solidifying my desire to innovate and create in the tech field.

## Beyond the Classroom

Outside academics, I’m a fun, easy-going, and extroverted person who enjoys tackling challenges and collaborating with others. 

- **Fine Arts:** Music has always been a significant part of my life. I've been in choir since 6th grade and continued my journey through show choir and jazz ensembles. During my sophomore year, I performed in the top jazz choir at my junior high school. Now, as a senior at Plano East, I’m proud to be a part of both the top choral choir and show choir. Working with my peers in these groups is incredibly rewarding, and I cherish every moment of performing and growing together.

## Looking Ahead

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects that leverage technology to solve real-world problems. My interests lie in areas like educational technology and sustainable computing—fields where I believe I can make a lasting impact. The rapid pace of technological innovation excites me, and I can’t wait to be a part of shaping the future.
