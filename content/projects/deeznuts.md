### Inspiration: 
This was my first project led me to where I stand today. At the time, I was in 8th grade and I loved using Discord to play video games with my friends. That led me to using a lot of bots, I thought it was really cool how discord had an entire community making projects that improved their app. Since I took Computer Science before I decided to learn how to use the Discord API and make a bot. 

I made some small ones, and some larger ones, but the one that really took off was the one that I least expected.

### What is it?

It was called "Deez Nuts" it's a Discord Bot that would respond to any message that contains a trigger word with a corresponding Deez Nuts joke. It was so dumb but was so funny.

At the height of the pandemic it peaked at about 2,500 guild all across the world, serving over 250,000+ users and being __one of the youngest developers to have a Verified Bot on Discord__.

The bot was running for about a year and a half. Currently, the bot is no longer available, it took a lot of time out of my personal life and I couldn't juggle the humungous community alongside my school and extracurricular activites, as well as the fact I was paying out of pocket for the bot.

This bot gave me an amazing opportunity to have a hands-on experience with developing and maintaining an application that is used by a large amount of people. 

### What did I learn from the bot?
- Proper Production vs Development deployment (It was not fun figuring that out at 14 years old)
- Load Balancing and Sharding
- GitHub Actions
- Automating Updates to ensure Uptime for all users
- MongoDB integration with NodeJS
- Making a API for handling events
- Managing a community of over 250,000+ users
- Using Microsoft Azure
